## Harness Roles

| Tool | Role | Use for optimization decisions? |
|------|------|----------------------------------|
| `timing_compare.py` | Current vs clean `HEAD` vs LuaJIT, calibrated repeats, scaling, CI, gap ranking | Yes, primary local timing harness |
| `strict_guard.py` | Broad truth pass: suite + extended + variants, checksums, suspicious-win review | Yes, release/regression gate |
| `diagnose.py` | Generic per-benchmark artifact bundle: timing, exits, runtime paths, Tier 2 perf, speculation state/worklist, optional pprof/warm pcmap | Yes, fastest first-pass diagnosis |
| `triage.py` | Focused timing + exits + optional IR/ASM and pprof artifact bundle | Yes, for planning the next optimization |
| `jit_addr_map.py` | Offline join from pprof/raw PCs to production-warm JIT IR/opcode PC maps | Diagnostic only |
| `profile_exits.py` | Tier 2 exit/deopt attribution | Diagnostic only |
| `rank_luajit_gaps.py` | Report/history ranking helper | Diagnostic/reporting |
| `regression_guard.py` / `.sh` | Older baseline regression workflow | Compatibility |
| `diagnose_tier2.sh`, `scripts/diag.sh` | IR/ASM dumps | Diagnostic only |

Keep suite, extended, and variants as separate benchmark groups in reports.
They can be run together with `--all-groups`, but do not collapse them into one
score: suite is the stable LuaJIT comparison set, extended is workload coverage,
and variants are overfit/correctness pressure tests.

Optimization benchmarks should be hot enough as checked-in programs, not only
after harness-level repetition. Treat sub-50ms default runs as smoke/regression
coverage unless the benchmark is explicitly about startup latency; increase the
benchmark workload itself before using it to drive JIT throughput work.

## Debugging Coverage

The toolchain is sufficient for the next optimization iteration when used as a
workflow:

- `timing_compare.py` decides whether a gap is real and records timing source,
  repeat count, CI, parameter scaling, and current-vs-HEAD-vs-LuaJIT deltas.
- `profile_exits.py` explains guard/deopt/exit pressure when performance is
  limited by fallback behavior.
- `triage.py` bundles timing, exits, optional IR/ASM, pprof, warm JIT dumps, and
  JIT PC maps for a focused target. It writes `triage.json` with bottleneck
  categories and accepts `--runtime-stats` for external path counter JSON/text.
- `-runtime-path-stats` / `-runtime-path-stats-json` reports native-call,
  coroutine, table-array, and string-format fast/fallback counters for cases
  where exits alone do not explain runtime cost.
- `-jit-dump-warm` captures production Tier 2 artifacts from the actual run,
  including code addresses and PC maps; this avoids drift from offline-only
  diagnostic compiles.
- `jit_addr_map.py` maps raw sampled PCs, or explicit PCs, back to JIT
  IR/opcode/source metadata from the same run. When the profile lacks native
  JIT PCs, it reports a structured failure reason and JIT/profile coverage
  summary so the missing mapping is diagnosable.

It is not a complete compiler observability stack yet. Remaining high-value
gaps are JIT symbol/perf-map integration so external profilers can name native
JIT frames directly, guard/deopt timelines correlated with tiering events,
allocation/call counters by runtime path, pass-by-pass optimization summaries
with code-size deltas, and automated differential/fuzz stress for optimized
fallback paths.

## Reading the output

`strict_guard.py` is the preferred truth pass before claiming benchmark wins.
It builds `cmd/gscript` once, discovers every `benchmarks/suite/*.gs`, every
extended benchmark in `benchmarks/extended/manifest.json`, and every
`benchmarks/variants/*.gs`, then runs each available cell in:

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `vm` | bytecode VM, no JIT |
| `default` | normal method JIT with `-jit-stats -exit-stats` |
| `no_filter` | method JIT with `GSCRIPT_TIER2_NO_FILTER=1` |
| `luajit` | matching Lua reference under `benchmarks/lua*`, when `luajit` is in `PATH` |

The strict report includes median timing, sample spread, repeat count, timing
source, output checksum hash, literal `checksum:` value when present, Tier 2
`attempted/entered/failed`, total exits, and a "Suspicious Kernel Wins" section.
That section calls out suite benchmarks that beat LuaJIT by a large margin but
are not confirmed by their structural variants. It is intentionally a review
signal, not a performance patch gate.

Use `--group=suite`, `--group=extended`, or `--group=variants` to narrow the
run; repeat `--bench=group/name` for a representative subset. `--dry-run`
prints the exact discovered matrix without building or running anything.

`timing_compare.py` is the preferred harness for local before/after timing when
the current worktree may differ from clean `HEAD`. It exports a clean `HEAD`
snapshot, builds both binaries, and compares `current`, `HEAD`, and LuaJIT for
selected benchmarks. Each cell automatically increases the repeat count until
the sample exceeds `--min-sample-seconds`; if summed script `Time:` remains
below `--timer-resolution`, the tool reports `wall_repeat` as the timing source
instead of treating `0.000s` as a real runtime. Wall fallback samples use at
least `--min-wall-repeat` invocations and are annotated because they include
process startup overhead. The table includes median, repeat count, CV, 95%
confidence interval half-width, and current Tier 2 exit counts; the Markdown
report also ranks selected benchmarks by current/LuaJIT gap. Use
`--mode=default`, `--mode=vm`, or `--mode=no_filter` to select GScript modes.
For sub-millisecond kernels, use `--scale=BENCH:VAR=VALUE`,
`--param=BENCH:VAR=VALUE`, or `--scale-profile=hot` to run temporary scaled
copies of matching GScript/Lua benchmarks. The report records each changed
parameter as `VAR:old->new`, so original and scaled problem sizes remain
explicit. `--time-source=script` rejects wall fallback and is best for hot-loop
claims; `--time-source=wall` uses high-resolution process wall time and is best
for end-to-end startup/compile measurements; `--time-source=auto` is the normal
default.

`regression_guard.sh` remains the preferred baseline regression tool for
method-JIT performance work. It builds `cmd/gscript` once, runs every core suite
benchmark in:

`official_perf_coverage.py` audits the translated official Lua correctness
cases against the hot-loop benchmark suite:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/official_perf_coverage.py \
  --markdown /tmp/official_perf_coverage.md \
  --json /tmp/official_perf_coverage.json
```

It does not time the official semantic cases directly. Most of those programs
are short assertions, so process wall time would mostly measure startup and
compiler overhead. Instead, the report classifies each official-case family as
`covered`, `partial`, or `semantic_only`, links covered families to existing hot
benchmarks, and lists official cases that look like candidates for extracting a
future hot benchmark. Use it together with `strict_guard.py`: the former tells
whether performance coverage is broad enough, while the latter proves that the
covered hot regions are not slower than LuaJIT.

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `VM` | bytecode VM, no JIT |
| `Default` | normal method JIT with `-jit-stats -exit-stats` |
| `NoFilter` | method JIT with `GSCRIPT_TIER2_NO_FILTER=1` |
| `LuaJIT` | matching `benchmarks/lua/<name>.lua`, when `luajit` is in `PATH` |

The table reports median wall time, `JIT/VM`, `JIT/LJ`, Tier 2
`attempted/entered/failed`, total Tier 2 exits, and a regression marker when
default JIT is more than 10% slower than `benchmarks/data/baseline.json`.
Each benchmark/mode/sample has its own timeout; a timeout or crash records that
cell and the runner continues with the rest of the suite. The process exits
non-zero only after the table is complete and at least one regression is marked.
Use `--runs=N` to choose median sample count for the guard. `--count=N` is an
alias for the same setting; it does not invoke Go benchmark `-count`. For Go
micro-benchmarks, use `go test ./benchmarks/ -bench=Warm -count=N`.

For the push-before-push workflow and report examples, see
[docs/perf/bench-guard.md](../docs/perf/bench-guard.md).

When diagnosing a perf anomaly, **read `-jit-stats` Tier 2 entered/compiled
counts before reasoning about the wall time**. Several past rounds (R132, R133–R139, R145)
burned time analyzing Tier 2 emit for benchmarks that were not even
running Tier 2 native code. See `docs-internal/diagnostics/debug-jit-correctness.md`
