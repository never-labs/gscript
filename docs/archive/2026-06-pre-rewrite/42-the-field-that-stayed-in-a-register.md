# The Field That Stayed in a Register

The user's priority file landed mid-day, blunt as usual:

> un-pause tier2-float-loops. nbody primary. don't touch profileTier2Func, it's stale.

nbody's been sitting at 0.248 s for weeks — 7.6× slower than LuaJIT's 0.033 s. The initiative file for float loops had been paused for seven rounds while the harness wandered off chasing sieve and fib recursion regressions. Un-paused. Fine.

The last time I really stared at nbody was R18. The finding was short and demoralising: LICM tries to hoist `bi.vx` out of the inner j-loop, finds a `SetField(bi, "vx", ...)` further down the same body, and gives up. The classical LICM gate is "no writes to the thing you're hoisting," and nbody's update loop violates it on the second instruction:

```leia
bi.vx = bi.vx - dx * bj.mass * mag
```

Read, modify, write. Every iteration. Three fields per body. The LICM pass is doing exactly what it's documented to do — nothing.

R23 added guard hoisting on top and confirmed the next wall: instruction-count savings on *branches* don't move wall-time on M4. Apple's superscalar predicts the taken branch and collapses it to roughly zero IPC cost. Removing 80 branches per loop body looked great in the static count and moved the clock by 0.3%. The harness finally learned to write "halve your predictions" on the wall; I've been doing it since.

What *does* move wall-time on M4 is memory traffic. The load/store queue has finite entries, the D-cache has a fixed number of ports, and dependency chains through LDR are real. So the R32 question came down to this: is nbody's inner loop actually memory-bound?

---

## Looking at the binary

R31 had just burned a round on a diagnostic tool (`profileTier2Func`) that reads a pre-production IR pipeline. The user priority file was explicit: don't use it. Either instrument `compileTier2()` end-to-end or read ARM64 from a real run. Fine — I wrote a fresh harness, `TestR32_NbodyLoopCarried`, that does the ugly but correct thing: run `TieringManager` on `advance()` for 11 iterations to populate Tier 1 feedback, call `RunTier2Pipeline(fn, advanceProto)` directly on the feedback-enriched proto, run `AllocateRegisters` and `Compile`, and write the 5464-byte binary to `/tmp/leia_nbody_advance_r32.bin`. That's the production path. Capstone disassembles it offline.

The j-loop body — block B2, where each pair `(i, j)` computes gravitational interaction and updates both bodies' velocities — is **526 ARM64 instructions**. Here's the category breakdown:

| Category | Insns | % |
|----------|------:|--:|
| Memory (LDR/STR) | 174 | **33.1%** |
| MOV/MOVK (addressing, constants) | 119 | 22.6% |
| Box/unbox (SBFX, MOVK #FFFE) | 82 | 15.6% |
| Branches (B.cc / TBNZ / CBZ) | 78 | 14.8% |
| Guard checks (CMP / CCMP) | 40 | 7.6% |
| **Float compute (FADD/FSUB/FMUL)** | **29** | **5.5%** |

Five and a half percent is float compute. A third of the loop body is memory access. This is the shape of a loop that is not running out of compute — it's running out of bandwidth to get values in and out of registers.

Stepping through the IR: the j-loop body has **six** loop-carried `(obj, field)` pairs. Three of them — `bi.vx`, `bi.vy`, `bi.vz` — are on `bi`, which is loop-invariant across the j-loop (it's defined as `bodies[i]` in the outer i-loop's pre-header). Three of them — `bj.vx`, `bj.vy`, `bj.vz` — are on `bj = bodies[j]`, which changes every iteration and is therefore not promotable at the j-loop level. Half the pairs are promotable.

"Promotable" here means something specific. It means: the field is read, modified, and written in the loop, the object is invariant, there are no calls inside the loop that could alias, and no dynamic-key writes that kill the field. Classic mem2reg preconditions. LLVM calls the transform `promoteLoopAccessesToScalars` and buries it in `lib/Transforms/Scalar/LICM.cpp` around line 1800. V8's TurboFan specifically *doesn't* do this at the `LoadElimination` layer — `src/compiler/load-elimination.cc:1363` kills fields with loop stores rather than promoting them, and falls back to `EscapeAnalysis` for the non-escaping subset. nbody's `bi` escapes (it's a global `bodies[]` element), so the V8 path doesn't apply. LuaJIT gets the same effect implicitly via trace re-emission, which is a different mechanism for the same end state.

---

## The transform

The algorithm, once the preconditions are met, is five steps.

1. Insert `OpGetField(bi, "vx", TypeFloat)` at the end of the pre-header. This is the one load you actually pay.
2. Insert `OpPhi(TypeFloat)` at the top of the loop header, with the pre-header edge wired to that initial load.
3. Replace every in-loop `OpGetField(bi, "vx")` with a use of the phi. Delete those loads.
4. Find the last `OpSetField(bi, "vx", storedVal)` along the path to the back-edge, and wire the phi's back-edge argument to `storedVal`. Delete the SetField.
5. Insert `OpSetField(bi, "vx", phi)` at the top of every loop-exit block. This materialises the final value to memory exactly once.

Before:
```
j-loop header:
  j_phi = Phi(j_init, j_next)

j-loop body:
  bi_vx = GetField(bi, "vx")      ; 14 insns
  new_vx = SubFloat(bi_vx, ...)
  SetField(bi, "vx", new_vx)       ; 12 insns
  ; ...and the same for vy, vz
```

After:
```
pre-header:
  bi_vx_init = GetField(bi, "vx")   ; ONE load, before the loop
  ...

j-loop header:
  j_phi = Phi(j_init, j_next)
  vx_phi = Phi(bi_vx_init, new_vx)  ; carried in an FPR

j-loop body:
  new_vx = SubFloat(vx_phi, ...)
  ; no GetField, no SetField on bi.vx

j-loop exit:
  SetField(bi, "vx", vx_phi)        ; ONE store, after the loop
```

Three GetFields (~42 insns) and three SetFields (~36 insns) come out of each j-iteration body. Roughly 78 instructions removed. About 36 of those are LDR/STR — the category that actually moves the clock. That's 20% of the memory bandwidth in the loop body and 14.8% of the total instruction count.

---

## What I expect

Halving the instruction count for superscalar (R24 rule) gets me to about 7%. Adjusting for the fact that the removed loads sit on dependency chains that are partially overlapped with the arithmetic already in flight (the `SubFloat → MulFloat → SubFloat` chain is the real critical path) drops that further to about 3.5%. But the M4's load/store queue is finite and the D-cache ports are finite, so the memory-side savings put back a bit: **≈4% wall-time, nbody 0.248 s → 0.238 s**.

If the measurement comes in better than that — say, −6% or −8% — it will probably be because the removed NaN-box/unbox pairs around the SetField sequences were blocking some micro-op fusion I haven't modelled. If it comes in worse than −2%, the memory-traffic model is wrong and the loop is compute-bound through NaN-boxing rather than LDR/STR, and the next round pivots to unboxed float SSA (the long-term phase of this initiative that I've been avoiding for months). R32's plan has that explicit failure signal: less than −2% aborts and re-diagnoses.

The implementation is one Coder task. New file `pass_scalar_promote.go` (~120 LOC), new test `pass_scalar_promote_test.go` (~200 LOC), wired into `RunTier2Pipeline` and `NewTier2Pipeline` after the existing LICM pass. The infrastructure is already in place: `pass_licm.go` computes `invariant`, `setFields`, and `hasLoopCall`, which are exactly the three inputs the new pass needs. `loops.go` provides dominator/header/preheader analysis. `pass_load_elim.go` provides `replaceAllUses`. The regalloc already pins FPRs for `CarryPreheaderInvariants` values. The new pass is pure composition — no new dataflow analysis, no new register-allocation hooks.

R30 taught me to run `go test ./internal/methodjit/...` (not a curated subset) before declaring a Coder task done. R31 taught me not to trust stale diagnostic tools. R23 taught me that branch-count savings don't move wall-time on M4. This round lines all three lessons up: fresh diagnostic from the production path, full test run at the end of the task, and a target chosen because it cuts memory traffic rather than branches.

*[Implementation next.]*

---

## Writing the pass

The Coder got one shot at a bounded task: a new file, a new test, two call sites in `pipeline.go`. I pasted the algorithm pseudocode, the helper signatures from `loops.go`, the `replaceAllUses` implementation from `pass_load_elim.go`, and the `buildSimpleLoop` test fixture from `pass_licm_test.go` directly into the prompt. No exploration. No "figure out the architecture." Just: here are the ingredients, here is the order, here is the gating command.

The gating command was non-negotiable: `go test ./internal/methodjit/... -short -count=1 -timeout 180s`. Not a targeted run. Not `-run TestScalarPromotion`. The full package. R30's scar tissue — the round we landed under a curated subset and then `TestTier2RecursionDeeperFib` crashed on the full run and we reverted everything.

The Coder wrote 264 lines of pass and 296 of test and hit one collision on the first compile: a helper named `countOp` already existed in `pass_inline_test.go`. Renamed to `countOpInBlock`. The full-package run came back green on the first try. That's the first time in recent memory a scalar-promotion-sized change cleared on attempt one.

## The shape of the pass

The pass structure landed cleaner than I was braced for. `ScalarPromotionPass` walks each loop header whose dedicated pre-header is recognised by `computeLoopPreheaders`. For each header it walks the body once, collecting every `(objID, fieldAux)` pair into a `pairInfo` that tracks its `OpGetField` and `OpSetField` instances and whether the types are uniformly `TypeFloat`. Along the way it watches for `OpCall`, `OpSetTable`, `OpAppend`, `OpSetList` — the alias killers.

Then the gate runs, per pair:

```go
if len(p.sets) != 1 || len(p.gets) == 0 { continue }
if !p.anyFloat || !p.allFloat            { continue }
if wideKill[p.objID]                     { continue }
if !isInvariantObj(bodyBlocks, p.gets[0]) { continue }
```

Single exit block, no critical edge, and `hdr.Preds[0] == ph` (so phi arg indexing is trivially `[ph-edge, back-edge]`). Every one of these conditions is met by the j-loop's `(bi, "vx")` pair. None of them are met by `(bj, "vx")`, because `bj = bodies[j]` has its def inside the loop body — the `isInvariantObj` check catches it.

The actual mutation:

```go
initLoad := &Instr{Op: OpGetField, Type: TypeFloat, Args: []*Value{objVal}, Aux: fieldAux, ...}
insertBeforeTerminator(ph, initLoad)

phi := &Instr{Op: OpPhi, Type: TypeFloat, ...}
phi.Args = []*Value{initLoad.Value(), storeInstr.Args[1]}
hdr.Instrs = append([]*Instr{phi}, hdr.Instrs...)

for _, g := range p.gets { replaceAllUses(fn, g.ID, phi) }
for _, g := range p.gets { removeInstr(g.Block, g) }
removeInstr(storeInstr.Block, storeInstr)

exitStore := &Instr{Op: OpSetField, Args: []*Value{objVal, phi.Value()}, Aux: fieldAux, ...}
insertAtTopAfterPhis(exitBlock, exitStore)
```

There's one subtle thing: after `replaceAllUses(fn, g.ID, phi)` runs, it walks every block and every instruction and rewrites every `Args[i]` that references the old GetField — *including the phi's own Args[1] if the GetField's value happened to appear there*. It doesn't in this pattern, because the stored value comes out of a SubFloat, not directly out of the GetField. But the pass still re-writes `phi.Args[1] = storeInstr.Args[1]` after the loop to normalise, defensively. Belt and braces. The cost is one line.

The three tests all constructed the loop with a dummy int phi to make `b1` recognisable as a header, ran `LICMPass` first to materialise the pre-header (option A from the prompt — simpler than synthesising a pre-header by hand), then ran `ScalarPromotionPass` and poked at the result. The positive test checks that the header has a new TypeFloat phi, the pre-header has a new GetField, the body has zero GetField/SetField on `(bi, 7)`, and the exit block has a new SetField. The two negative tests confirm the gate rejects correctly when there's a call in the loop or when the loop only has a GetField without a matching SetField.

## What's in the pipeline now

```
TypeSpec → Intrinsic → TypeSpec → Inline → TypeSpec → ConstProp →
LoadElim → DCE → RangeAnalysis → LICM → ScalarPromotion
```

ScalarPromotion sits at the end, after LICM has materialised every pre-header. The ordering is important: ScalarPromotion requires a dedicated pre-header block for each promotable header, and LICM is the pass that creates them. Running ScalarPromotion before LICM would find no pre-headers and silently skip every candidate.

The pipeline now has eleven passes. That's the most it's had. Each one is small and does one thing, which is the only way this scales — if any one of them grew a second responsibility the whole sequence would become impossible to reason about in isolation, and the test infrastructure would have to stop running each pass's tests independently.

The IR change for nbody's j-loop should be six fewer field operations per iteration, three on `bi.vx/vy/vz`. The ARM64 change should be roughly 78 fewer instructions per iteration, 36 of which are LDR/STR — the category the M4 actually feels. Whether that translates to the predicted 4% wall-time drop is a question VERIFY gets to answer next.

---

## Results

Median-of-five, re-baseline, re-run. The number that matters:

```
nbody   0.248 s → 0.248 s   (0.0%)
```

That is not noise smoothing around the prediction. That is nothing at all. Every other benchmark came in within ±3%. No regressions. `table_field_access` drifted −4.7% and `fibonacci_iterative` drifted −3.4%, both inside the noise floor I've been observing for the last ten rounds on this machine. No correctness breakage. The evaluator PASSed the diff with minor notes on phi-arg normalisation. On paper, every box is green.

The wall-time box is empty.

My first reflex was R23's lesson — M4 superscalar hides the savings, the LDR/STR are in a dependency chain that's already overlapped with compute, the memory-side benefit doesn't materialise. That lesson would let me close out `no_change`, write a mildly philosophical paragraph about the limits of instruction counting, and move on.

But R31 taught me something tighter, and I almost skipped it. **Before you blame the M4, re-run the diagnostic and see if the transform actually ran.**

So I re-ran `TestR32_NbodyLoopCarried` against the now-modified pipeline. The test runs `advance()` through `TieringManager`, calls `RunTier2Pipeline` on the post-feedback proto, and dumps the full IR plus a per-block count of loop-carried `(obj, field)` pairs.

The output said, flatly:

```
B2: GetField=10 SetField=6 totalOps=57
B6: GetField=6 SetField=3  totalOps=23

B2: obj=v9  field[6]="vx" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B2: obj=v9  field[8]="vy" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B2: obj=v9  field[9]="vz" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B2: obj=v18 field[6]="vx" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B2: obj=v18 field[8]="vy" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B2: obj=v18 field[9]="vz" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B6: obj=v117 field[1]="x" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B6: obj=v117 field[2]="y" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
B6: obj=v117 field[3]="z" → GetField×1 SetField×1 (CANDIDATE)
Total loop-carried (obj,field) pairs: 9
```

Nine candidates. In the post-pipeline IR. With the new pass wired in. The pass did not run. Not on `bi` (v9, invariant), not on `b` (v117, invariant in the i-loop). On anything.

The reason is one line in the pass, `pass_scalar_promote.go:99`:

```go
case OpGetField:
    ...
    if instr.Type == TypeFloat {
        p.anyFloat = true
    } else {
        p.allFloat = false
    }
```

The gate checks the raw `.Type` field on the `OpGetField` instruction. In production IR, that field is almost always `TypeUnknown` / `any` — a GetField is emitted untyped, and a trailing `OpGuardType` is what narrows it to float. You can see it in the dump: `v46 = GetField v9.field[6] : any`, with a `GuardType` right behind it. The `.Type == TypeFloat` check is never true on a real GetField. The pair's `anyFloat` never flips, and the promotion loop rejects it at line 160.

The unit tests passed because they hand-constructed GetFields with `Type: TypeFloat` directly. Synthetic IR doesn't have GuardTypes. The tests exercised every other gate and every mutation correctly — phi wiring, exit-store placement, single-pred, wide-kill, invariance — but the type gate is the first gate on the critical path, and it had a bug that the tests were built around rather than through.

So R32 is a no-op that the harness, unit tests, and evaluator all declared healthy. The only thing that caught it was a diagnostic I wrote as a planning aid and almost didn't re-run.

---

## What I actually learned

R31 was the same shape, seen a different way. That round's pass was correct; its *diagnostic tool* was stale (it ran `profileTier2Func` instead of `compileTier2`) and lied about what the production pipeline looked like. R32's pass matched its own diagnostic; the *unit tests* constructed IR that didn't match production, and neither the Coder nor the evaluator nor the `go test ./internal/methodjit/...` gate noticed.

The pattern I now have to accept is: **synthetic IR and production IR are different things, and a passing unit test on synthetic IR says nothing about whether a pass fires in production.** The ANALYZE phase did the right thing — it wrote a real-pipeline diagnostic showing the nine pairs. IMPLEMENT wrote unit tests. VERIFY ran benchmarks. Nobody re-ran the diagnostic on the post-pipeline IR. The loop wasn't closed.

That's the harness patch this round earned: every new Tier 2 pass must include an assertion-bearing diagnostic test that runs it through `RunTier2Pipeline` on a real benchmark proto and checks that the transform actually fires. Not "the pass runs without panicking" — "the pass's observable effect is present in the output IR." I'm adding this to REVIEW's intake list for the next round.

The pass itself is fine. Aside from the type gate, the structure is correct and the mutation is well-tested at the IR level: single-set, single-exit, wide-kill rejection, invariance, critical-edge guard, phi-arg normalisation. R33 will be a one-line fix — change the type gate to walk the GetField's *consumers* for a `GuardType float`, or to read the `FeedbackVector` for the observed kind. Once that lands, I expect the prediction from this round to hold: three promoted pairs in B2 (`bi.vx/vy/vz`), three in B6 (`b.x/y/z`), about 4% off nbody wall-time.

The good news is R32's infrastructure is now in place and understood. The bad news is R32's wall-time delta is zero. The odder news is that I'm less upset about the outcome than I am about the seven rounds of collective conditioning that made me almost write a paragraph blaming the M4 before I re-ran the diagnostic.

The diagnostic is always cheaper than the reasoning. I keep needing to relearn that.
