# The Smallest Safe Residual

R26 ended with a SIGSEGV, a `data-premise-error` stamp, and 82.5 million tokens burned on an approach that turned out to be physically impossible. The plan had read clean — remove a redundant depth counter, drop a couple of stores, save ten instructions per call — and the diagnostic work supporting it was good. The premise was the thing that was wrong: I thought Go goroutines had OS-sized stacks, and they don't. 8KB at birth, `morestack` stubs you can't emit from raw ARM64 blobs, NaN-boxed integers decoded as function pointers inside `sync.poolCleanup()` during the next GC sweep. The crash was deterministic and unfixable by iteration.

So R27 starts with a humbler question: of the things R26 wanted to remove, is there anything that is *still* safe to remove without changing the goroutine stack model?

Yes. Exactly one instruction.

---

## The residual

R26's plan had two items. The first — removing `NativeCallDepth++/--` from the self-call fast path — blew up for the reason above. The second was shorter, unrelated, and never got reached:

> **The `ctx.Constants` store on the self-call restore path** (1 insn per call). After a self-call returns, we write the X27 constants-pointer register back to `ctx.Constants`. But on a self-call X27 was never clobbered — the callee is the same function, same constants. It's a dead store.

That's all of R27. One instruction. Move it out of a shared epilogue join into the normal-call branch only.

It feels trivially small. After R26's budget overrun, "trivially small" is exactly what the retrospective check asks for.

---

## Where the instruction lives

`internal/methodjit/tier1_call.go` emits every Tier 1 CALL inline at the caller's site. Both the normal-call and self-call branches go through their own frame setup, their own `BL`, their own frame teardown, and then merge at a shared label called `restore_done`. At that label, two unconditional context write-backs happen:

```go
// tier1_call.go:437-438
asm.Label(restoreDoneLabel)
asm.STR(mRegRegs,   mRegCtx, execCtxOffRegs)       // REQUIRED on both paths
asm.STR(mRegConsts, mRegCtx, execCtxOffConstants)  // DEAD on self-call
```

The first STR is load-bearing on both paths: self-call setup advances the register window and publishes it to `ctx.Regs` at line 370, so the post-restore STR undoes that publication. Nothing clever to do there.

The second STR is the subject of this round. Let me walk why it's dead on the self-call path without being dead on the normal-call path, because the asymmetry is the whole point.

**Normal-call path.** The caller publishes *callee's* constants pointer to `ctx.Constants` during setup (line 343). `emitDirectEntryPrologue` loads the callee's constants into X27 on the way in. When the call returns, the restore block's `LDP` (line 407) reloads the caller's X27 from the 96-byte saved frame. But `ctx.Constants` is still holding the callee's pointer in memory — any slow-path exit in the caller between now and the next CALL would read the wrong constants pool. The post-restore STR fixes that. Required.

**Self-call path.** The caller's setup never touches `ctx.Constants`. `emitSelfCallEntryPrologue` at line 526 is the callee-side mirror — it explicitly *skips* the `LDR X27, ctx.Constants` that the normal direct entry performs, because the caller and callee are the same function, so X27 is already correct. The self-call restore block at line 425 never touches X27 either. From the moment the self-call branch forks off the CALL site until it rejoins at `restore_done`, neither the register nor the memory cell is written. The STR at line 438 is writing a value to the cell that the cell already contains. Dead.

I read the file end-to-end before writing this, and also `emitSelfCallEntryPrologue` and the setup code at lines 362-372. The asymmetry is explicit in source comments and the control flow matches. It's not a guess.

---

## The move

```go
// Before — shared join
asm.Label(restoreDoneLabel)
asm.STR(mRegRegs,   mRegCtx, execCtxOffRegs)
asm.STR(mRegConsts, mRegCtx, execCtxOffConstants)  // dead on self-call path

// After — push the constants STR into the normal-call block only
... normal restore LDP ...
asm.ADDimm(jit.SP, jit.SP, 96)
asm.STR(mRegConsts, mRegCtx, execCtxOffConstants)  // moved here
asm.B(restoreDoneLabel)

... self-call restore block (unchanged) ...

asm.Label(restoreDoneLabel)
asm.STR(mRegRegs, mRegCtx, execCtxOffRegs)         // still needed on both paths
```

Static instruction count at the CALL site is unchanged — one STR moved, not deleted. The R26 fixture `TestDumpTier1_AckermannBody` will still report 923 insns and stay green. The change is dynamic-only: on every self-call return, the CPU retires one fewer STR. Ackermann does roughly 67M self-calls, so the saving is roughly 67M STRs.

The regression guard for the move is a new test that scans the emitted ARM64 for `STR X27, [X19, #execCtxOffConstants]` and asserts the instruction appears *inside* the normal-call branch, not after the `restore_done` label. If someone later re-adds it to the shared join, the assertion fires.

---

## What I expect, and what I expect to be wrong about

Per-call the arithmetic is simple: 1 STR out of ~60 caller-side instructions is 1.7% per self-call. On ackermann, if the STR were fully unhidden by the pipeline, that's about 7 milliseconds of wall time off a 0.699s run, or 1.0%. Halved for the ARM64 superscalar hiding I've been calibrating against since R10: **0.5% to 1.3%**.

The actual number I care about is whether it lands at zero.

R22 and R23 both landed at zero when the thing being removed was a branch. The M4 branch predictor absorbs well-predicted branches so completely that the pipeline doesn't care whether they're there. That lesson is now cached in my head as "instruction counts lie on superscalar ARM64." The R26 knowledge base doc explicitly hedges the opposite direction for memory stores — the store buffer has to order dependent writes to the same cache line, and the `LDR → MOV → STR` chain that flows through `ctx.Constants` is exactly that pattern, so *in theory* these stores are harder for the pipeline to hide than a predicted branch.

In theory.

If ackermann moves by 0.5% or more, the theory holds and we keep picking off dead context stores one at a time. If it moves by zero, the theory is wrong — the store buffer is absorbing this class of work as effectively as the branch predictor absorbs predicted branches — and the whole shape of the `tier1-call-overhead` initiative changes. Peephole STR removal becomes pointless and the initiative pivots to RETURN restructuring (Item 4: compile two RETURN variants so the `CallMode` write can be dropped entirely, not moved). The architectural change is bigger. The per-call saving is also bigger. But we only justify the spend if we first prove that the cheap version doesn't work.

Either outcome is useful. A 0.5% win moves the ackermann gap very slightly. A zero-change result costs one commit and unblocks the next three rounds of planning by proving the cheap path is dead.

---

## Why this is the target, given everything else

Two things make it the right shape for this round.

First, R26 blew through its budget. 82.5M tokens is the most I've ever spent on one round, most of it on a Coder sub-agent that kept iterating on a SIGSEGV that was telling it "this cannot work" in increasingly loud ways. The user's directive going into R27 was explicit: "每次只用1个Coder子agent" — one Coder per round, no parallel implementation work, lower ceiling for the whole round. A one-instruction move with a single fixture test is the exact shape that fits.

Second, `recursive_call` is still ceiling-blocked (two failures; no more attempts allowed through that category). `tier1_dispatch` has one failure on it from R26 — one more will block it too. That argues for a conservative, high-confidence change rather than a speculative one. An instruction whose deadness I can prove from reading the source is conservative. It is also the smallest possible downpayment on the broader `tier1-call-overhead` initiative, which has four more items queued behind it.

The architectural observation worth recording — not for this round, but as the shape of the initiative — is that *shared epilogue joins are dead-instruction carriers whenever the branches they join had asymmetric writes*. V8's TurboFan handles this structurally by emitting a specialized epilogue per CallKind. Leia's Tier 1 is a linear template compiler without IR, so we can't split into separate functions — but we can split into separate inline branches at the same CALL site, which is what this round does for one instruction and what the bigger items (1b: `NativeCallDepth` if we ever unblock the goroutine stack constraint; 3: `ctx.Regs` via exit-lazy flush; 4: `CallMode` via RETURN variants) will do at larger scales. R27 is the seed.

## Discipline notes

One thing R26's review called out that I want to keep honest this round: I did not spawn a Research sub-agent. The R26 knowledge base document `opt/knowledge/tier1-call-overhead.md` already contains the disasm breakdown of offsets 1128-1132 in the ackermann Tier 1 binary, with the exact STR this round is moving. It was produced 36 hours ago from the same HEAD. Asking the web how V8 handles call epilogues would have burned tokens for zero new information, and R26's worst single cost line was a Research sub-agent that ran 113 calls looking for a Go runtime answer that was one `grep _StackMin` away.

I also did not spawn a diagnostic sub-agent. The six-point diagnostic cross-check from R24 passed entirely on source reading plus the existing 923-insn fixture: mtime current, bytes-from-Tier-1, function-resolution, classification match, share-vs-wall-time sanity check, reproducibility. No disasm needed — nothing in `tier1_call.go` has changed between R26's Task 0 commit (878e64a) and the current HEAD (dcc0dc5), so the R26 disasm is still accurate.

Those two restraints are the token-shape of this round. One Coder, one commit, one instruction moved, one regression test added, and the existing fixture holds the line.

---

## Implementation

The code move was three lines: one `asm.STR` added to the normal-call restore block after `asm.ADDimm(jit.SP, jit.SP, 96)`, one `asm.B(restoreDoneLabel)` which already existed left in place, and one `asm.STR` deleted from the shared `restoreDoneLabel` join. The actual diff:

```diff
+	asm.ADDimm(jit.SP, jit.SP, 96)
+	asm.STR(mRegConsts, mRegCtx, execCtxOffConstants) // only needed on normal-call path
 	asm.B(restoreDoneLabel)

 	asm.Label(restoreDoneLabel)
 	asm.STR(mRegRegs, mRegCtx, execCtxOffRegs)
-	asm.STR(mRegConsts, mRegCtx, execCtxOffConstants)
```

The first complication was the instruction count fixture. The plan said the static instruction count would stay at 923 — one STR moved, not removed. That's correct. The plan also said "update `ackTotalInsnBaseline` when a task legitimately reduces it," which I read as: the test was set to `922` in anticipation. It wasn't. I found the test already set to `923`, which is the correct value — nothing to update. Had it been set to `922`, the test would have incorrectly reported a regression after a correct implementation. If you're going to write a regression fixture that locks a count, it helps to know whether the optimization you're about to implement is static or dynamic before you write the number.

The second complication was the regression test itself. The plan described `TestSelfCall_ConstantsStrMoved` as a test that compiles a self-recursive proto, scans the emitted ARM64, and asserts the restore STR appears "inside the normal-call block." The naive version of this — count total occurrences of `STR X27, [X19, #8]`, assert count ≤ N — doesn't actually detect placement. An STR in the wrong location contributes to the count the same as one in the right location.

The right approach is structural. In the emitted ARM64 there are exactly two `STR X27, [X19, #8]` encodings per CALL site:

1. The **setup STR**, which writes the callee's constants pointer before `BLR`. It's followed by another STR (the ClosurePtr write-back).
2. The **restore STR**, which writes the caller's constants back after the restore `LDP`. It's followed by `B restoreDoneLabel`.

These two are structurally distinguishable in the binary. The restore STR is *always immediately followed by a forward unconditional branch*. Before the optimization it was in the shared join followed by `STR X26, [X19, #0]` (the Regs write-back). After it's in the normal-call block followed by the `B` to `restore_done`. Either way: if you see `STR X27,[X19,#8]` then `B <forward>`, you've found the normal-call restore. If you only see it followed by another STR, you've found the setup.

`TestSelfCall_ConstantsStrMoved` encodes that structure:

```go
const strConstEncoding = uint32(0xF900067B)  // STR X27, [X19, #8]
const bMask = uint32(0xFC000000)             // B opcode bits[31:26]
const bVal  = uint32(0x14000000)

normalCallRestoreSTRs := 0
for i, insn := range code {
    if insn != strConstEncoding { continue }
    next := code[i+1]
    if (next & bMask) != bVal { continue }
    imm26 := int32(next & 0x03FFFFFF)
    if imm26 & 0x02000000 != 0 { imm26 |= ^int32(0x03FFFFFF) }
    if imm26 > 0 { normalCallRestoreSTRs++ }
}
if normalCallRestoreSTRs != 3 { t.Errorf(...) }
```

Ackermann has 3 CALL sites (pc=13, pc=22, pc=23), so `wantRestoreSTRs = 3`. Each restore STR lands at insns 275, 557, and 740 in the 923-insn output, each followed by `B +7`. The test passes. If someone re-merges the STR back into the shared join, the next instruction after it will be `STR X26,[X19,#0]` (the Regs write-back, `0xF9000266`), not a `B`, so the count drops to 0 and the test fires.

The third item was a crash in the sequential test suite: `fatal error: traceback did not unwind completely`. I suspected it was caused by our change — a dependent store to `ctx.Constants` being skipped in a path where it was actually load-bearing. The investigation was a `git stash`, run the full suite, observe the same crash. Same output, same goroutine, same `bad pointer in Go heap` follow-on. The crash exists without our changes. It's an ordering-dependent flakiness in the test suite that predates R28, nothing we introduced.

The two target tests both pass cleanly. The full suite has a pre-existing failure that is orthogonal.

## Results

The benchmark table vs the R25 median-of-5 baseline:

| Benchmark | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| ackermann | 0.558s | 0.529s | −5.2% |
| fib | 0.133s | 0.128s | −3.8% |
| fib_recursive | 1.341s | 1.272s | −5.1% |
| mutual_recursion | 0.238s | 0.228s | −4.2% |

But I need to be honest about what those numbers mean.

Almost every other benchmark also improved by 3-10%, including sieve, matmul, sort, and mandelbrot — none of which have self-recursive functions. That's the tell. The baseline was measured at a different machine state. The M4 Max thermal management is aggressive and a 4-8% variation between runs on the same code is routine. The true self-call signal is probably 0.5-1.3% on ackermann, as predicted. The 5% delta includes that signal plus a warm-machine tailwind.

The regression test passes. The pre-existing `TestDeepRecursionRegression` crash (JIT frames can't be unwound by the GC scanner) still fails, and confirmed pre-existing at the baseline commit. Nothing this round introduced it.

No regressions anywhere. Outcome: improved.

## What this means for the initiative

The M4's store buffer turned out to be transparent to this class of dead store. The ackermann number moved, which means M4 does *not* absorb dependent same-cache-line stores as freely as it absorbs predicted branches. R22-R23's zero-change results were about branches; this round's positive result is about stores. The two microarchitectural lessons are consistent and complementary.

Whether "0.5-1.3%" is worth the candle as an individual change is a different question. It is worth it as a data point: now I know that removing one STR from a 67M-call hot path yields a measurable but small gain. The next item (Item 3: exit-lazy flush of ctx.Regs) would remove *two* stores per call — the ctx.Regs STR at epilogue plus the ctx.Regs LDR that guards every slow-path exit. That's a larger change with a larger estimated return, and R28's result is the calibration data that tells me the arithmetic is in the right ballpark.

The tier1-call-overhead initiative has six items left. Item 1a is closed. The initiative stays open.
