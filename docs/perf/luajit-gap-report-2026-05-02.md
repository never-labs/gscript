# LuaJIT gap report - 2026-05-02

## Scope

This report records the current main worktree benchmark comparison from
2026-05-02. The numbers below are median-of-3 results for GScript default JIT
and the local LuaJIT reference.

It also records a follow-up `strict_guard.py` median-of-5 pass over the current
remaining gaps. That guard is the preferred steering tool for this stage because
it compares `default`, `no_filter`, and `luajit`, preserves checksums, and emits
JSON/Markdown artifacts for ranking.

`0.000s` means the printed timing is below the harness display precision. It
does not mean literal zero runtime.

## Interpretation

The April 29 report is now historical. It correctly identified `matmul`, `fib`,
`spectral_norm`, `sort`, `mutual_recursion`, `sieve`, and `ackermann` as the
largest comparable LuaJIT gaps at that point. The current run no longer
supports that ranking.

Most measured core-suite rows are now ahead of the local LuaJIT reference.
`table_field_access` is at parity. The remaining comparable gaps are
concentrated in:

| Benchmark | GScript JIT | LuaJIT | Gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| coroutine_bench | 0.019s | 0.009s | 2.11x slower |
| table_array_access | 0.019s | 0.010s | 1.90x slower |
| string_bench | 0.015s | 0.009s | 1.67x slower |
| closure_bench | 0.014s | 0.009s | 1.56x slower |

Those are runtime and microbenchmark-shaped gaps rather than the old broad
numeric, recursive, and table-heavy kernel gaps.

## Strict guard follow-up

Command shape:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/strict_guard.py \
  --bench table/table_array_access \
  --bench calls/coroutine_bench \
  --bench calls/closure_bench \
  --bench string/string_bench \
  --bench table/table_field_access \
  --bench app/mixed_inventory_sim \
  --bench concurrency/producer_consumer_pipeline \
  --bench app/actors_dispatch_mutation \

```

Ranked by best GScript mode against LuaJIT:

| Benchmark | Best GScript | LuaJIT | Gap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| app/mixed_inventory_sim | 0.152s | 0.022s | 6.91x slower |
| app/actors_dispatch_mutation | 0.039s | 0.011s | 3.55x slower |
| concurrency/producer_consumer_pipeline | 0.127s | 0.043s | 2.95x slower |
| calls/coroutine_bench | 0.019s | 0.00925s | 2.05x slower |
| table/table_array_access | 0.018s | 0.010s | 1.80x slower |
| table/json_table_walk | 0.031s | 0.017s | 1.82x slower |
| calls/closure_bench | 0.0145s | 0.00875s | 1.66x slower |
| string/string_bench | 0.013s | 0.008s | 1.62x slower |
| string/log_tokenize_format | 0.133s | 0.083s | 1.60x slower |
| table/table_field_access | 0.019s | 0.019s | parity |

This changes the active work queue. The largest current gaps are now the
extended mixed table and dispatch programs, not the old core numeric kernels.
`no_filter` is mostly neutral on the largest gaps, so broad gate relaxation is
not an evidence-backed direction.

The `json_table_walk` row reflects the follow-up string-format intrinsic change
landed after the initial strict-guard pass. It reduced the no-filter median
from 0.042s to 0.031s and cut the exit stream from roughly 54k exits to 571,
with matching checksums.

## Negative follow-up evidence

Three follow-up worktrees tested obvious small changes against the largest
remaining gaps. None cleared the merge bar:

| Target | Tested direction | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| app/mixed_inventory_sim | larger/open-addressed `string.format` result caches, stronger string hash, larger string-lookup probe limit, `math.floor` Fast1 path | regressed or failed to reproduce a win under the full guard |
| app/actors_dispatch_mutation | Tier 2 native-call envelope trimming, polymorphic `GetField` bounds-check trimming, typed-string `Len` fast path | at best 2.5-5%, below threshold; some nearby workloads moved the wrong way |
| concurrency/producer_consumer_pipeline | small fixed-arity `NewTableFromCtorN` constructor fast paths | no material win; two variants regressed |

The useful diagnostic findings are:

```text
mixed_inventory_sim:
  broad no-filter/Tier2 admission is unsafe; forced variants can crash native
  code. The remaining gap needs a more principled runtime/table strategy.

actors_dispatch_mutation:
  run_world reaches Tier 2, but warm dumps showed zero useful type feedback for
  actor.kind, so it remains an untyped GetField feeding generic Len. The next
  real direction is feedback timing or polymorphic field type propagation, not
  local emit shaving.

producer_consumer_pipeline:
  constructor allocation remains hot during coroutine resume, but helper-level
  constructor rewrites do not pay. A real win likely needs allocation/escape
  strategy for yielded fixed-shape payload tables.
```

## Parallel follow-up evidence

A later three-worktree development round retested the next obvious local
directions with the same strict-guard workflow. It produced no mergeable code,
but it narrowed the safe search space:

| Target | Tested direction | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| table/table_array_access | store-loop preallocation threshold change and earlier typed-table kind verification | threshold change regressed the median from about 0.018s to about 0.041s; typed-kind cleanup stayed around 0.019-0.020s |
| calls/coroutine_bench / concurrency/producer_consumer_pipeline | Tier 1 `OP_NEWOBJECTN` cache path for the five-field yielded payload | no win; `producer_consumer_pipeline` moved from about 0.128s to 0.141s on the first guard and 0.133s on rerun |
| app/actors_dispatch_mutation | delayed Tier 2 until field-dispatch feedback exists; narrower `FBString -> TypeString` propagation | delayed Tier 2 changed checksum and created an exit storm after actor mutation; string propagation was correctness-clean but stayed around 0.041s |
| app/mixed_inventory_sim | earlier Tier 2 admission for single-call long table loops; dense no-lock integer `string.format` result cache | broad admission did not enter Tier 2 in default mode and broke no-filter checksum; dense cache had no default-mode win |

The resulting constraints are:

```text
table_array_access:
  do not relax store-loop preallocation thresholds without a new invariant; the
  current threshold protects the hot row.

coroutine / producer_consumer_pipeline:
  the hot allocation is in the coroutine child VM interpreter path, not the
  parent Tier 1 path. Parent-side native constructor caches miss the bottleneck.

actors_dispatch_mutation:
  delaying compilation for more field-dispatch feedback is unsafe when the
  benchmark mutates actors mid-run. The next viable direction needs feedback
  that is useful before mutation or a guarded polymorphic path that can deopt
  without restart/checksum drift.

mixed_inventory_sim:
  Tier 2 admission gates are protecting correctness. The remaining cost is
  dominated by baseline exits around calls and large string-map lookup, but
  simple format-cache/hash/probe/cache-density changes have not moved the
  default median.
```

## Recommended wording

Use this as the current docs summary:

```text
On the 2026-05-02 median-of-3 local Darwin/arm64 comparison, GScript default
JIT is ahead of the local LuaJIT reference on most measured core-suite rows,
at parity on table_field_access, and still behind on table_array_access,
coroutine_bench, closure_bench, and string_bench. Timings printed as 0.000s
are below benchmark display precision, not literal zero runtime.

On the follow-up median-of-5 strict guard, the largest remaining comparable
gaps are app/mixed_inventory_sim, app/actors_dispatch_mutation,
concurrency/producer_consumer_pipeline, and table/json_table_walk.
```

Avoid current-tense claims that `matmul`, `fib`, `spectral_norm`, `sort`,
`mutual_recursion`, `sieve`, or `ackermann` are still the largest LuaJIT gaps.
Those claims are now only correct when explicitly framed as April 2026 history.
