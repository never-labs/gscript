// graph_builder_unknown_op_test.go pins the default-case behavior of
// the Tier 2 graph builder's bytecode switch. Any opcode that lacks an
// explicit case must flip fn.Unpromotable so the function falls back
// to Tier 1 cleanly instead of silently emitting a Nop and corrupting
// downstream SSA register liveness (the failure mode that produced the
// "Jump in middle of block" bug behind commit deebbcf).
